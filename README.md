# SQL Warehouse

A structured overview of **Data Warehouse Architecture**, showcasing how raw data from various sources is transformed into business-ready insights. This repository represents the logical layers of a modern data warehouse pipeline.

## 📌 Architecture Overview

The SQL Warehouse follows a multi-layered architecture that organizes data transformation and consumption through the **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.

## 🧩 1. Sources

**Data Sources:**
- CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
- ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)

**Object Type:**
- CSV Files

**Interface:**
- Files placed in folders

---

## 🥉 2. Bronze Layer – Raw Data

- **Object Type:** Tables  
- **Load Type:**  
  - Batch Processing  
  - Full Load  
  - Truncate & Insert  
- **Transformations:** None  
- **Data Model:** None (as-is)

This layer stores unprocessed data directly from the sources.

## 🥈 3. Silver Layer – Cleaned & Standardized Data

- **Object Type:** Tables  
- **Load Type:**  
  - Batch Processing  
  - Full Load  
  - Truncate & Insert  
- **Transformations:**  
  - Data Cleansing  
  - Data Standardization  
  - Data Normalization  
  - Derived Columns  
  - Data Enrichment  
- **Data Model:** None (as-is)

This layer enhances the quality of data through cleaning and normalization.

## 🥇 4. Gold Layer – Business-Ready Data

- **Object Type:** Views  
- **Load Type:** No Load (logic-based views)  
- **Transformations:**  
  - Data Integration  
  - Aggregations  
  - Business Logic  
- **Data Models:**  
  - Star Schema  
  - Flat Table  
  - Aggregated Table

This layer provides refined, analytical datasets tailored for business use.

## 📊 5. Consumption Layer

The final outputs from the Gold Layer support:

- 📈 BI & Reporting  
- 🧪 Ad-Hoc SQL Queries  
- 🤖 Machine Learning  

---

## 🗂️ Repository Goals

- Demonstrate a structured approach to Data Warehouse modeling  
- Showcase SQL transformations and design patterns  
- Provide reusable SQL scripts for ETL pipelines

---

## 📎 Future Enhancements

- Add example SQL scripts for each layer  
- Integrate with BI tools (Power BI, Tableau)  
- Automate ETL pipelines using orchestration tools
